# 420 kc

A boss KC tracker with a number fixation.

## What it does

Shows a sidebar panel with kill counts for all bosses, pulled from the RS hiscores. Hover a boss to see your collection log completion for that boss — items obtained, items remaining — sourced from TempleOSRS.

Right-click any player in-game to look up their KC. Works for any account type.

## The 420 thing

When your KC on any boss hits 420, it turns green. That's it. That's the feature.

**420 Mode** has three settings:
- **OFF** — just a normal KC tracker
- **ON** *(default)* — exactly 420 KC glows green
- **CAP** — 420 or above shows as `420` in green, forever

Chat messages can also mark the milestone locally in your chatbox.

## Setup

Install from the Plugin Hub. If you want collection log data in tooltips, sync your clog via the TempleOSRS plugin first.

Set a default player in config to load a specific account on startup, or leave it blank to use whoever's logged in.
